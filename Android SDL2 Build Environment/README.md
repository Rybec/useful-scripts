This Bash shell script will create a command line build environment for SDL2 Android apps written in C/C++, on Debian based systems.  Sadly, it will not work on Raspberry Pi, because Google has not seen fit to create Android SDK or NDK builds that will run on ARM.

When this script finishes, you should have an `Android` directory in your home directory.  It will contain a `projects` directory, where you will find a template project.  This can be copied to create a new project.  A makefile is included that can build your app (for x86 and armeabi), package it, and install it onto a connected Android device (that has developer mode activated).
